# Staple the notarization ticket into the already-notarized macOS artifacts, then
# re-sign the regenerated updater tarball. Runs on a short macOS job AFTER Apple has
# Accepted the submissions (xcrun stapler is macOS-only), so the bundles ship
# offline-resilient instead of relying on an online Gatekeeper check.
#
# For each arch the build leg produced a .dmg and a .app.tar.gz (+ .sig). We submitted
# the .dmg to notary, which also notarizes the nested app's code identity, so stapler can
# fetch a ticket for both the dmg and the app by cdhash.
#
#   1. Staple the .dmg in place.
#   2. Extract the .app from the updater tarball, staple it, re-tar to the SAME filename,
#      and re-sign with the Tauri (minisign) updater key.
#   3. Re-upload the stapled dmg + regenerated tarball + new .sig to the draft release.
#
# Usage: notary-staple.sh <dir-with-dmg-and-tarballs> <release-tag>
